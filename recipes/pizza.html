    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The pierogi are filled with cheese, potatoes, and mushrooms but you can use the dough recipe and stuff them with other fillings to your liking. There are many ways to serve pierogi - either topped with fried onions and parsley or serve them with sour cream, melted butter, and fried pieces of bacon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce (such as Don Peppino®)</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Cheese:</li>
        <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>

    <h3>Cheese:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
       
        <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
        
        <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
        
        <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
        </ul>
