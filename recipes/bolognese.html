    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add ground turkey and cook until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add carrots, onion, celery, garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease, if necessary. Add white wine; cook and stir until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce, tomato juice, and parsley. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce reaches a thick consistency, about 20 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Add the sauce and Parmesan cheese; mix well. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>
